Roadblock:

![Roadblock](https://github.com/sirredbeard/WLE/raw/master/Capture3.PNG)

- Need to figure out "networking" issue above. "The specified network name is no longer available." is a Windows I/O error message, not a Windows one.

Todo:

- Add in WLinux config file tweaks.
- Update license details.
- License better icon/logo.
- Move install/config of sudo from DistInfo to actual build script.
